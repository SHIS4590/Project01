                Hayao Miyazaki was born on January 5, 1941, in the town of Akebono-cho in Bunkyō, Tokyo, the second of four sons.His father, Katsuji Miyazaki (c. 1915 – March 18, 1993),was the director of Miyazaki Airplane, which manufactured rudders for fighter planes during World War II.The business allowed his family to remain affluent during Miyazaki's early life.In 1944, when Miyazaki was three years old, his family evacuated to Utsunomiya.
                After the bombing of Utsunomiya in July 1945, Miyazaki's family evacuated to Kanuma.The bombing left a lasting impression on Miyazaki, who was aged four at the time.From 1947 to 1955, Miyazaki's mother suffered from spinal tuberculosis; she spent the first few years in hospital, before being nursed from home.Miyazaki's mother was a strict, intellectual woman who regularly questioned "socially accepted norms".She died in July 1983 at the age of 71.<br>
